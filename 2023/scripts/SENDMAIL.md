In order to send the e-mails, you have to authenticate yourself.

A description is here: 
	- https://scriptreference.com/sending-emails-via-gmail-with-python/
	(this reference is gone from Internet and wayback machine
	can't find the pictures on it)
	- https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python

The oauth2 has been created already, so it is a matter to download the 
json file.

It is designed to read this json as ~/.ssh/pyconse-email-oauth2.json.
Once the file is there, you can run "pyconse-email-pickle.py" to
authenticate via browser and save into a pickle file.
